# Casino Predict

## Rules
Imagine a Casino Machine, there are 40 numbers from 1 to 36, and two special numbers 0 and 00
1 - 18 are defined as small number
19 - 36 are defined as large numbers
starting from 1 to 36, every 2 numbers are black and red
You can choose from red / black, even / odd, small / large and of course 0 and 00 each time
The wheels will spin and will land on a number which would be 1 of each 3 categories, 0 and 00s are not considered as any of the above

## How to use
Initialize a die each time with a color (one of red or black) and a value (number) ranges from 1 to 36
Add dies to the casino machine and each time you can predict which will give you a selection or some selections with highest probability

## Assumptions
We are assuming each number in these 38 choices are independent and have equal probability of 1/38.
